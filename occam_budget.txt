Project: 

   My first react project is to create a simple expense budget tracker. Idea is to keep track of the expenses made in a month. If time permits will add a dashboard with graph to show the expense trends. 

   1. Front page provides the description to the user and allows him to login (Will create with one user, will extend to signups if time permits)
   2. In the signin page user can login which allows to authentocate with firebase
   3. Sign in page takes them to dashboard page where expenses and transactions are displayed 
   4. User is allowed to add a transaction (will extend to update)
   

   Expected package dependencies: 

    1. react
    2. react-dom
    3. react-router-dom (links)
    4. firebase (authentocation and storage)
    5. react-bootstrap
    6. react-chartjs (Charts)
    7. moment (for time and dates)
